tasks

OK	make a function that, from an image, samples two random numbers (far enough from each other) and returns two augmented versions
OK	expose backbone's intermediate activations
OK	complete RankingAndBackbone`s forward step by passing the two versions through the backbone and using the intermediate activations for the ranking layer to guess which image is more augmented
OK	complete RankingAndBackbone`s training and validation steps
OK	make it train faster!
OK	do some sanity tests
	extract relevance information from the ranking model (multiply the standard deviation and activations?)
	replace the augmentation with class-specific information and see what happens
