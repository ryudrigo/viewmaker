tasks

OK	make a function that, from an image, samples two random numbers (far enough from each other) and returns two augmented versions
OK	expose backbone's intermediate activations
OK	complete RankingAndBackbone`s forward step by passing the two versions through the backbone and using the intermediate activations for the ranking layer to guess which image is more augmented
OK	complete RankingAndBackbone`s training and validation steps
	make it train faster!
	extract relevance information from the ranking model (multiply the standard deviation and activations?)
	do some sanity tests
	replace the augmentation for class-specific information and see what happens
